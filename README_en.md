  - `aimo-user-service`: User management service, handling user registration, profile management, etc.
  - `aimo-diary-service`: Diary and mood management service, providing diary creation, query, sentiment analysis, etc.
  - `aimo-social-service`: Social functionality service, including posts, comments, likes, and other social interaction features
  - `aimo-ai-service`: AI assistant service, providing intelligent conversation, content recommendation, and other AI features
  - `aimo-membership-service`: Membership management service, handling member subscriptions, benefits management, etc.
  - `aimo-admin-service`: Admin backend service, providing system management, data statistics, etc.
  - `aimo-message-service`: Message processing service, responsible for system notifications, user messages, and other asynchronous processing

### Frontend Applications

- `aimo-web`: Contains frontend applications
  - `aimo-admin-vue`: Admin dashboard frontend (Vue.js)
  - `aimo-mobile-app`: Mobile application frontend

## Infrastructure Services

The project depends on the following infrastructure services, managed through Docker Compose:

- **Nacos**: Service registration, discovery, and configuration center (Ports: 8848, 9848, 9849)
- **MySQL**: Database service (Port: 3336â†’3306)
- **RabbitMQ**: Message queue (Port: 5672, Management UI: 15672)
- **MinIO**: Object storage service (Port: 9000, Console: 9001)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 17 or higher
- Maven 3.6.3 or higher
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git

### Environment Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <https://github.com/RiverXue/AIMO.git>
   cd AIMO
   ```

2. **Start Infrastructure Services**

   Use Docker Compose to start the required infrastructure services:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

   This will start Nacos, MySQL, RabbitMQ, and MinIO services.

3. **Build Backend Microservices**

   Navigate to the `aimo-services` directory and build all modules:

   ```bash
   cd aimo-services
   mvn clean install -DskipTests
   ```

4. **Run Backend Microservices**

   Start services in the following order:

   ```bash
   # 1. First start the gateway
   cd aimo-gateway
   mvn spring-boot:run

   # 2. Start the authentication service
   cd ../aimo-auth-server
   mvn spring-boot:run

   # 3. Start the user service
   cd ../aimo-user-service
   mvn spring-boot:run

   # 4. Start other services as needed
   ```

5. **Frontend Applications**

   Instructions for developing and running frontend applications will be provided in their respective directories.

## Configuration

### Service Configuration

Configuration files for all microservices are located in the `src/main/resources` directory of each module:

- `bootstrap.yml`: Contains connection information for the Nacos configuration center
- `application.yml`: Contains basic configuration for the service

### Database Configuration

By default, the MySQL service is configured as follows:

- Host: localhost
- Port: 3336
- Username: root
- Password: 123456
- Default Database: aimo_user_service

## API Documentation

The project integrates Springdoc OpenAPI (Swagger), which can be accessed via the following URLs:

- Gateway API: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
- Microservice APIs: http://localhost:[service_port]/swagger-ui.html

## Development Progress

### Project Completion Assessment

**Overall Completion: Approximately 30%**

#### Completed Parts

1. **Project Architecture Design**:
   - Microservice architecture design completed
   - Infrastructure services configuration not completed (Nacos, MySQL, RabbitMQ, MinIO) (temporarily postponed, to be implemented after all modules are developed)
   - Docker Compose environment configuration not completed (temporarily postponed, to be implemented after all modules are developed)

2. **Basic Framework Setup**:
   - Directory structure for all microservice modules created
   - Independent dependency management and basic configuration roughly completed
   - Spring Cloud Alibaba integration not completed (temporarily postponed, to be implemented after all modules are developed)

3. **Partial Core Functionality Implementation**:
   - User service basic functions (registration, login)
   - Social service partial functions (post management)
   - Diary service basic functions

4. **Infrastructure Optimization**:
   - Redis dependency removal, simplifying deployment

5. **Frontend Development**:
   - Admin dashboard frontend (Vue.js): Development not yet started
   - Mobile application frontend: Development not yet started
