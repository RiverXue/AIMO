# AIMO Mobile App

This directory is intended for the AIMO mobile application frontend. The specific technology stack (e.g., React Native, Flutter, or a hybrid framework) will be determined and implemented in a future phase.

## Project Status

Currently, this directory serves as a placeholder. Detailed development will commence after the backend services are stable and core functionalities are established.

## Future Considerations

-   **Technology Stack**: Potential options include React Native, Flutter, or a progressive web application (PWA) approach.
-   **Development Environment**: Will depend on the chosen technology stack.
-   **API Integration**: Will consume APIs exposed by the `aimo-gateway` and other backend services.

## Getting Started (Future)

Once the mobile application development begins, this `README.md` will be updated with detailed instructions on:

-   Prerequisites
-   Installation of dependencies
-   Running the development server
-   Building for production
-   Configuration details
